# Artificial Intelligence (AI)
* The effort to automate intellectual tasks normally performed by humans.

The best way to describe machine learning is that it’s a technique of AI which uses statistics to learn from data. 
Rather than giving the program the rules, an algorithm finds the rules for us.

### 1. Supervised learning
Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. It infers a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples.

### 2. Unsupervised learning
Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning in which the algorithm is not provided with any pre-assigned labels or scores for the training data. As a result, unsupervised learning algorithms must first self-discover any naturally occurring patterns in that training data set. 

### 3. Reinforcement learning
Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how intelligent agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward. Reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning.


# Deep learning (DL)
A form of machine learning that uses a layered representation of data.
It’s a technique of ML which uses the concept of neurons to learn from data.
